When I work on any of my projects, I always aim to create functions that are reusable. For instance, in my current project, I've developed a pricing calculation function that proves to be incredibly helpful. This function can be easily implemented on any page by providing certain parameters, and it generates the desired result. Additionally, I can modify the calculation logic in just one place, and the changes automatically affect all instances where the function is used. This approach allows me to optimize the performance of my project.
